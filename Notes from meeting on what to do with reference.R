# Notes from meeting

#Look at Demographic make up of top programs


## look at MSm -> Residents overtime -
# Look at how many applied v.s matrivulatted
### how many matched is broken up by year: 2001-06,2007-12, 2013-2019
# Look at all demographics- seperate (based on urim at points)
# URIM - definition AAMC- (look up)
# Black, Alaskan, Hawaiian, Latinx/Hispanic,
# Exclude unknown/multiple from comparison-
# November 1st- 11am EST
# Look up recent publications, Like beget like- secondary outcome of paper
# look at other specialties, work within field what we are adding.

###-underrepresented minority (URM),= Blacks,#Mexican-Americans, 
#Native Americans (that is, American Indians, 
#Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians), and mainland Puerto Ricans


## Reference example of what they did for stats
#Results: The median percentage of students per medical school who pursued RO 
#residency was 0.37% (interquartile range, 0.16%-0.66%). 
#A total of 79.7% of schools graduated at least 1 RO resident, whereas 51.7%
#graduated at least 1 female RO resident and 14.0% graduated at least 1 URM RO 
#resident. The 30 schools graduating the highest percentage of RO residents
#accounted for 52.1% of current RO residents, only 4 of which were in the top
#quartile for URM enrollment. Medical students were significantly more 
#likely to pursue RO when there was an affiliated RO department (0.42% vs 0.18%,
#P < .001) or RO residency program (0.51% vs 0.18%, P < .001), 
#more total RO faculty (rs Z 0.521, P < .001), 
#female RO faculty (rs Z 0.481, P < .001), 
#and URM RO faculty (rs Z 0.197, P < .001). 
#The probability of at least 1 female student pursuing RO was also

correlated with the number of female faculty in the affiliated RO department (rpb Z 0.348, P Z .001), and a similar correlation was observed between URM students and URM faculty (rpb Z 0.312, P Z .011).
